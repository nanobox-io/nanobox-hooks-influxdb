# nanobox InfluxDB configuration
#

### Welcome to the InfluxDB configuration file.
# Once every 24 hours InfluxDB will report usage data to usage.influxdata.com
# The data includes a random ID, os, arch, version, the number of series and other
# usage data. No data from user databases is ever transmitted.
# Change this option to true to disable reporting.
reporting-disabled = <%= config[:reporting_disabled] %>
# we'll try to get the hostname automatically, but if it the os returns something
# that isn't resolvable by other servers in the cluster, use this option to
# manually set the hostname
# hostname = "localhost"

### [meta]
### Controls the parameters for the Raft consensus group that stores metadata
### about the InfluxDB cluster.
[meta]
  dir = "/data/var/db/influxdb/meta"
  retention-autocreate = true
  logging-enabled = true
  pprof-enabled = false
  lease-duration = "1m0s"

### [data]
### Controls where the actual shard data for InfluxDB lives and how it is
### flushed from the WAL. "dir" may need to be changed to a suitable place
### for your system, but the WAL settings are an advanced configuration. The
### defaults should work for most systems.
[data]
  enabled = true
  dir = "/data/var/db/influxdb/data"
  wal-dir = "/data/var/db/influxdb/wal"
  wal-logging-enabled = true
  data-logging-enabled = true
  cache-snapshot-memory-size = 2621440

### [coordinator]
### Controls the clustering service configuration.
[coordinator]
  write-timeout = "10s"
  max-concurrent-queries = 0
  query-timeout = "0"
  log-queries-after = "0"
  max-select-point = 0

### [retention]
### Controls the enforcement of retention policies for evicting old data.
[retention]
  enabled = true
  check-interval = "30m"

### [shard-precreation]
### Controls the precreation of shards, so they are available before data arrives.
### Only shards that, after creation, will have both a start- and end-time in the
### future, will ever be created. Shards are never precreated that would be wholly
### or partially in the past.
[shard-precreation]
  enabled = true
  check-interval = "10m"
  advance-period = "30m"

### [monitor]
### Controls the system self-monitoring, statistics and diagnostics.
### The internal database for monitoring data is created automatically if
### if it does not already exist. The target retention within this database
### is called 'monitor' and is also created with a retention period of 7 days
### and a replication factor of 1, if it does not exist. In all cases the
### this retention policy is configured as the default for the database.
[monitor]
  store-enabled = false # Whether to record statistics internally.
  store-database = "_internal" # The destination database for recorded statistics
  store-interval = "10s" # The interval at which to record statistics

### [admin]
### Controls the availability of the built-in, web-based admin interface. If HTTPS is
### enabled for the admin interface, HTTPS must also be enabled on the [http] service.
[admin]
  enabled = <%= config[:admin_enabled] %>
  bind-address = "<%= config[:admin_bind_address] %>"
  https-enabled = <%= config[:admin_https_enabled] %>
  https-certificate = "<%= config[:admin_http_certificate] %>"

### [http]
### Controls how the HTTP endpoints are configured. These are the primary
### mechanism for getting data into and out of InfluxDB.
[http]
  enabled = <%= config[:http_enabled] %>
  bind-address = "<%= config[:http_bind_address] %>"
  auth-enabled = <%= config[:http_auth_enabled] %>
  log-enabled = <%= config[:http_log_enabled] %>

  pprof-enabled = <%= config[:http_pprof_enabled] %>
  https-enabled = <%= config[:http_https_enabled] %>
  https-certificate = "<%= config[:http_https_certificate] %>"
  ### Use a separate private key location.
  max-row-limit = 10000
  realm = "InfluxDB"

### [subscriber]
### Controls the subscriptions, which can be used to fork a copy of all data
### received by the InfluxDB host.
[subscriber]
  enabled = true
  http-timeout = "30s"

### [[graphite]]
### Controls one or many listeners for Graphite data.
[[graphite]]
  enabled = false
  ### This string joins multiple matching 'measurement' values providing more control over the final measurement name.
  ### Default tags that will be added to all metrics.  These can be overridden at the template level
  ### or by tags extracted from metric
  ### Each template line requires a template pattern.  It can have an optional
  ### filter before the template and separated by spaces.  It can also have optional extra
  ### tags following the template.  Multiple tags should be separated by commas and no spaces
  ### similar to the line protocol format.  There can be only one default template.

### [collectd]
### Controls one or many listeners for collectd data.
[[collectd]]
  enabled = false

### [opentsdb]
### Controls one or many listeners for OpenTSDB data.
[[opentsdb]]
  enabled = false

### [[udp]]
### Controls the listeners for InfluxDB line protocol data via UDP.
[[udp]]
  enabled = false

### [continuous_queries]
### Controls how continuous queries are run within InfluxDB.
[continuous_queries]
  log-enabled = true
  enabled = true
